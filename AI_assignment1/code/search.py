# search.py


"""
In search.py, you will implement generic search algorithms (A* and Dijkstra)
that operate on any problem implementing the SearchProblem interface below.

For this assignment you will formulate TWO problems against this interface:
    1. Robot Navigation with Obstacles 
    2. Courier Delivery Route Planning 

You will implement a SearchProblem subclass for each (in separate files,
e.g. robotNavigation.py and courierDelivery.py), then write generic
aStarSearch and dijkstraSearch functions here that work on either subclass
purely through this interface.

    abstract class).

    You do not need to change anything in this class, ever. Instead, you
    will write problem-specific subclasses (for Robot Navigation and for
    Courier Delivery) that implement each of these methods.
